# What are SVGs?
**SVG** stands for **Scalable Vector Graphics**. As the name suggests, SVGs are scalable. Insanely scalable.

## How cool are SVGs?
- They are insanely scalable. They can be displayed on any screen, printed anywhere, without losing quality. SVG defines vector graphics using XML format. All paths defined inside the SVG are relative to its `viewBox` and have nothing to do with the `size` of a given SVG.
- They are small and fast (they are just a few lines of code and have significantly less size compared to PNGs and JPEGs).

## Then why not use SVGs everywhere?
SVGs do not work well when it comes to actual pictures. They cannot replicate the fine details and texture.

## What do I need to know before learning about SVGs?
A little bit of how HTML or XML works.
